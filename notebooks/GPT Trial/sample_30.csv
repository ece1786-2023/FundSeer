15,https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-drews-new-jaw,Support Drew's New Jaw,About 3 years ago Drew began feeling pain in his jaw After several scans and various doctors visits he discovered he had advanced TMJ degradation of a large joint in the jaw Though this was treated it was simply a symptom of a greater problem which he later discovered This greater problem  the source of his ongoing pain and sleeplessness  now must be addressed According to doctors its time to stop applying bandaids and start solving the problem at its source So here are the problems and surgeries needed to solve themProblem 1 Drews upper palate is too concave and it has caused a severe deviated septum As such his sleep is incredibly poor and his oxygen levels at night can sometimes dip low If left unaddressed this could cause greater and more serious problems down the roadSolution  Drew will have upper jaw reconstruction ie palatal expansion followed by the surgical installment of a palate bridge allowing the palate to expand and heal over the course of 12 weeks The expansion of the palate will also widen his nasal passage ensuring more oxygen flow during sleep It is possible this surgery will negate the need for a future deviated septum surgeryProblem 2 the poorly developed upper palate has created a narrow mouth which in turn means the surrounding anatomy is too cramped This is part of the reason Drew developed TMJSolution  the above jaw reconstruction will widen Drews mouth creating the necessary space for oral and facial anatomy In addition Drew will have to wear a facialjaw brace for 10 months at 12 hrs a day which will pull his jaw forward an estimated 3mm This increased distance will help alleviate his intense joint pain and provide the needed solution for any future TMJ problemsProblem 3 several muscle groups need to be surgically released tongue lips cheeks which will provide future relief from pain and increased airflow while sleeping Imagine a tonguetie release on steroids  now you get the pictureSolution  Drew will immediately begin myofunctional therapy to prepare him for these frenuloplasty surgeries Once his therapist deems his muscles ready usually 68 sessions he will have the muscles released His postop care will include another 810 sessions of myofunctional therapy as well as speech therapy as he will have to relearn how to speak and enunciate clearlyFinally Drew will have to wear upper and lower orthotics to ensure his bite expands with his expanding upper jaw No hate on tooth gaps but in Drews case it would not be a good look Allinall Drew is looking at several months of surgeries and about 12 or more of postop therapy His surgeon is located in the Seattle area 3 hr  drive so there will be lots of traveling Sadly insurance has decided these are all elective outofnetwork surgeries and therefore wont cover any of the costs Every penny donated will go toward the massive stack of expenses Drews family has had to pay outofpocketThank you so much for supporting Drew and his family They have been overwhelmed by the support and care It means the world to them,27000.0,27938.0,1,en,"[190, 4, 364, 653, 53, 249, 494,

81,https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-me-complete-my-healing-journey,Help me complete my healing journey,Hi AllI never expected to be in this situation  I guess nobody really doesAs some of you may be aware I was diagnosed with nonHodgkins lymphoma in March of 2020 It has progressed from the initial diagnosis of Stage 3 to Stage 4 a year later It is mainly on the right side of my body  neck armpit stomach groin etc  and mainly in my lymphatic systemAs a result I have made radical changes and dedicated myself to healing My goal is to kick this affliction for good So far it has been an incredible journey and I have much to be grateful for There may be a book one of these daysThe good news is that it is a slow growing cancer It has probably been developing for years In most circumstances it is very treatable although my situation is a little more complicated I have been asked why I have not taken conventional treatments ie radiationchemo etc After consulting with numerous top physicians I was advised it has progressed too far for conventional treatment Also that it would likely do more harm than good while offering no guarantee of improvement I did not go against the advice of my doctors Thankfully I have been given the opportunity to pursue other healing modalities My healing journey so far Please ask Im happy to share additional detailsMajor diet and lifestyle changes  Daily yoga meditation and breathwork practicesLots of work on thought patterns and Positive thinkingSpiritual workMultiple modalities of healing and natural medicines The latestGreat news my last PET scan in February 2022 shows the cancer has stopped progressing I feel great physically and am confident that Im moving in the right direction Feeling much less symptomatic except for occasional tiredness After leaving California I spent the previous year in Colombia I am currently in Peru working with plant medicine in combination with fasting My next stint will be from February 22 for 45 days involving several treatments I am currently working with the Shipibo and have found this very helpful I have previously used the plant medicine ayahuasca but this will not be part of my treatment in the foreseeable future My reason for doing this Up to this point my diagnosis and journey have been relatively private It was not my sudden desire to publicize this but I realized I need to let those who care about me know what is happening in my life I believe it is time for a general public update of my situation So no one has to speculate about my conditionAs you would expect my finances have taken a major hit  Ive had to step out of the business world and survive on loans and help from family This is unsustainable My intention is to put this chapter of life behind me by June if not sooner I wish to get on with the business of living Im currently at a critical moment that requires all of my focus and attention This is why I decided to request help by launching a GoFundMe Im confident I am on a healing path but dont have the funds to continue my treatment Having adequate funds will remove much stress and anxiety allowing total dedication to my healing Please dont feel obligated to donate But if you have the available funds and are so inclined I would much appreciate it As part of my healing path Im happy to share my journey If you like please reach out although my time and Internet are limited so I cannot guarantee a quick response It always makes me happy to receive messages from friends and familyIn any case wish me luck I think Ive got this  I just need to get it over the line now Thank you all for being in my life  Ill see you on the other side alive not the other other side,10000.0,17992.0,1,en,"[326, 616, 1212, 1792, 2141, 582, 506, 2142, 585, 1128, 1570,

Rhabdomyosarcoma Levi has relapsed And its aggressive Their friends have created this page to provide them with urgent and muchneeded support Levis diagnosis is extremely rare There have been maybe 30 cases ever recorded Everything about Levis diagnosisthe location of the tumor his age the genetic markers etc contributes to its rarityTo give Levi the best possible outcome Emilie and Bill are seeking opinions advice tests and treatments from pediatric experts while caring for their familys daily needs And this is where we all can support them So many friends have been reaching out to us and asking how they can help This is a marathon for sure and Bill  Emilie have only begun Here are some ways that you can support Emilie Bill and LeviSharing this link on your Facebook pagewell wishes

consults treatments and other unexpected expenses that families battling pediatric cancers encounterEmilie and Bill appreciate all of the support and assistance that youre willing to offer during this challenging timeLevis StoryIYou may remember we just celebrated clear scans on 11323 I use the term celebrate loosely because while there is a feeling of relief there is never a feeling of assurance Worry and fear remain present even during good news because rhabdomyosarcoma is a beast It comes back fast and strong as we learned last week Levi has relapsed And it is aggressiveTo be blunt the odds are not in his favor We are working diligently to find resources to support him and spoke with his Oncology team to come up with a plan Timeline  DetailsSunday 2523  Bill found a lump around Levis pelvisgroin area We called the oncall Oncology line to get the ball rolling to see Dr Aye as soon as possible the following week Tuesday 2723  Saw Dr Aye in the clinic and had an Ultrasound  lab work done His labs look great The US showed a large mass measuring 22X22x32 but was ultimately inconclusive The confusing part of this was that his diagnosis ARMS relapses locally Meaning atnear its original site It doesnt like to travel so far away  its rare to relapse at a different location but not impossible So at this point more imaging was ordered  we had hoped it could be something benign Friday 21023  Full body PET scan  chestabdomenpelvis CT scan We went in at 630 am got home around 1115 am  got the call around 2 pm Not only does the pelvic mass look like cancer relapse but there are a total of 7 masses 5 small ones in his chest 1 large in his lower esophagus  the large pelvic mass we knew aboutThis changes Levis diagnosis to stage 4 metastatic Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma About as aggressive as it gets Metastatic means a lot of spread and the tendency to come backWeve spent all of our time grieving and snapping into action An ARMS relapse generally has a less than 10 survival The odds are lower for a child his age With this in mind we are aggressively pursuing anyall treatment options from conventional medicine chemo integrative care naturopathic oncologyetc Anything we can find to support his body through another round of treatment and improve his longterm survivabilityWe are 100 continuing to seek CURATIVE care I had a call with a rhabdo expert from CCTDI yesterday and he has directed us towards 3 doctors for 2nd opinionscollaborations as well as a unique biopsy testing I have contacted those 3 doctors as well as 2 others for support From an integrative perspective we have a discovery call scheduled with a practitioner on Tuesday to learn about her methods We also found a clinic in Wisconsin and will pursue a package with her that includes medical record reviews and a custom naturopathic protocol  dietary recommendations alternative treatments and supportive care Im waiting to hear back from 2 other integrative oncologists The next steps are a procedure to place another port take a tissue biopsy and do a bilateral bone marrow biopsy Biopsies will be sent off for pathology usually resulting 710 days later Although this is currently a presumed Rhabdo relapse there is a chance it could be secondary cancer  which would require a completely different treatment plan Assuming it is a Rhabdo relapse Levi would begin 3 drug chemo protocols temsirolimus vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide as an outpatient regimen This treatment protocol can last up to 20 months provided he responds to it and his body can handle it Radiation is not intended at this time but will be an ongoing discussion As you can imagine we are devastated The good news is that so far Levi feels good and is behaving like a normal toddler that LOVES to climb on everything Hes playful eating well and continues to expand his vocabulary daily Owls are his favorite thing right now Some friends have set up a gofundme site to support this phase of secondline treatment added testing and any integrative approaches we pursue as most of that will not be covered by insurance Ill share that and any information we learn later this week We appreciate your

are a  service focused family of 5 seeking financial hardship relief due to Richards physical ongoing inability to serve as a community pharmacist due to hostile recent work environments where his PTSD disability was viewed as problematic by staff including targeting Moreover since the beginning of the pandemic the increasing stress levels of many frontline healthcare professionals have been intolerable affected our own health status After 2yrs of being as careful as possible and frequent testing to keep my own family safe as close contact from dispensing testing vaccinating in store and at long term and memory care facilities all over north texas I was blessed to not have caught covid19 until August of 2022 from widowed father who lives with us He was positive and contagious for 3 weeks We tried to keep him isolated the best we could but I eventually contracted covid19 and the neurological pain is a daily management issue This is definitely a weird space because for 22 Yrs as a pharmacist Ive never been unable to work for this extended period of time I still hold true to the belief that the true servants who were purposed by God to serve without any expectations find ourselves in a very difficult predicament when we do actually need assistance  As my pharmacist Oath as stated that I raised my hand and took it before graduation in a church in Memphis Tennessee my  primary concerns are the welfare of humanity and the alleviation of human suffering Unable to serve the sick as he attends to his very serious health which require more testing but is currently without job insurance stepping done due to public safety risk  concerns at his previous job Most problematic has been managing new onset hearing hypersensitivity which required ear plugs at workwhich became a problem for staff  at home sleep disturbances leading sleep deprivation caused nocturnal seizures  night sweats unexpected nervous twitches during the day lastly the absolute most debilitating problem is the pain in the form muscle spasms all over teeth clinching feet clawing the floor right leg stiffening  a pain that con only be described as it hurts all at the same time Short term disability  long term exhausted with no medical conclusion because more medical testing is required per primary care doctor  neurologist Medical bills have become insurmountable on and off due to PTSD was infrequent but since covid  increasing job duties causing stressful toxic  dangerous works place environment which many pharmacies most become these days Still seizure like activity more neurological testing at home telemetry neuromuscular testing  neuroimaging required Unfortunately no insurance at the moment leaves my family in a position that we must sell the house asap Despite having CPTSD from early childhood traumas Richard D Broussard dedicated 22 yrs of public service as a community pharmacy all over North  East Texas  I prayed about it Richard got into the health profession because I have a heart for healing whose in need inside and outside the pharmacy I truly belief the redemption of unearned suffering form my childhood sexual traumas very early in life gave me the humility compassion  empathy to serve others at the highest level of patient care We are seeking financial assistance to continue to serve those deemed the least of these Prior to illnesses and since the beginning of Covid19 pandemic  feeding the underserved HIV patients and their children at the Revlon house in DallasTx with Prince of Peace Catholic Church in Plano TX for 2 yrs  feeding the homeless with local churches  During Covid19 my family  another local organization coordinated efforts to feed over 1000 children  families in the most impoverished area of Dallas as the meal we not bused to the school children 60 of who only eat breakfast  lunch at the school We secured food from Cornerstone Baptist Chruch in Dallas Tx We identified food insecurity as a persistent  pervasive problem therefore undertook 100 community gardens on 100 church properties as a lofty yet obtainable goal as we have access to unlimited free resources from relationships with Texas AM AgriLife MLK seedling farm and Big Texas State Farm Dallas College of Agriculture under the direction of Restorative Farms It did cost the church an expense to implement or instill a sustainable food source our  took in a homeless young lady who was sleeping on the church ground at the church we we gifting a community garden We found out she who was just released from the hospital from fainting from anemia She started helping is in the garden to be a part of something and a sense of belonging Several weeks later   My wife Sharla was cooking a meal and said she felt compelled by the holy  spirit to go feed her So she drove 30 miles to the church to hand her a warm plate of food But The Holy Spirit moved again saying you can not leave her here on the church ground to sleep another night in 100 degree heat  So my wife discussed it with me and she brought her home Provided shelter assisted her in getting a job Shortly after  she abruptly left  our home has served as a place of healing  for those going through a divorce  in which the devastation required community healing  provided shelter for battered mothers and security for their young children for up to 68 months  provided shelter  support for friends of family with simply no other place that would take them in provided shelter for Sierra Sims  Tommy Sims music legend as we connected his daughter to

we were about to connect Sierra with Parkland Hospital  North Texas Behavioral health   community household and mentoring parents for many summer to our youngest son Amarion seven friends from junior high up until graduation 2023  took in a sexually abused 12 yr old girl after Childrens Hospital in Dallas after receiving a late night phone call that the child had been given alcohol and drugs
