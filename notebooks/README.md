## Steps to Run a Notebook

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

   This will open Jupyter in your default web browser.

3. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the "notebooks" folder.

4. Click on the notebook you want to run (e.g., `gfm_baseline_model.ipynb`).

5. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially by clicking the "Run" button or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.

6. Follow any additional instructions provided in the notebook.

7. Review the output and analysis within the notebook.

Remember to install any required Python libraries before running the notebooks. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Note: Some notebooks may require specific datasets or pre-trained models. Refer to the documentation within each notebook for data and model availability.
