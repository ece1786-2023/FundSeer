Hi, my name is Julie Tarin.  I am a 33 year old wife and mother of two. 

As many of you know I was diagnosed unexpectedly with kidney disease a few years ago and have been on dialysis since April.

 I got the news that I will be receiving the best gift anyone could give me, a healthy kidney. I will be getting my transplant from a living donor in March.

Although my transplant center pays for all major medical expenses there are still many out-of-pocket expenses that are not covered. These funds I raise would go towards helping my family as well as my living donors family (hotel stays, gas, loss of wages, etc.)



Thank you.
